I have this idea, primarily for my own education. A number of simple systems to allow one to get in at the base level of various things. I’d like them to be as small as possible, preferably a single file, pure python, with the default libraries. Candidates:

Web Server
Network monitor (Like Nagios)
Database (using a sqlite3 backend)
LDAP (maybe.)
FTP
Telnet
SSH (I don’t know how doable this is)
SMTP
POP3
A shell like BASH

Cloud file server
Diff based RESTful file collaboration system
