import socket

# First we need a socket, this base most piece of software is what we will
# build everything on. It is instantiated with two constants:
# AF_INET: Address Family INet. I couldn't find any definative evidence on
#   what "INET" stands for so I think of it as "InterNET" as it refers
#   specifically to IPv4. You could also do AF_INET6 if you needed to
#   communicate over IPv6
# SOCK_STREAM: One of a couple of options, though the only other one that
#   appears to be useful these days is "SOCK_DGRAM" or Datagram protocol.
#   While it doesn't explicitly say it in the documentation, it appears that
#   SOCK_DGRAM is used to get a UDP socket. SOCK_STREAM however is  used to
#   get a TCP socket.
# Most of the time these are the two you will want, it is all I've ever used.
con = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# We will be connecting to an open telnet server with a few utilities on it.
# Replace this line with whatever server you might be interested in
# connecting to along with the appropriate port, usually 23.
con.connect(('telehack.com',23))

# We are going to use a time out to provide interactive behavior. In a more
# serious setting this would not be acceptable. But as this is an exercise
# in telnet not in threading we are going to use the easy way.
con.settimeout(1)

# These handles are left as place holders. Should there be desire to develop
# this simple script into a more real client these handlers would need to be
# more fleshed out. But the idea of how commands in general would be handled
# is demonstrated here. Specifics are left as an exercise to the reader.
