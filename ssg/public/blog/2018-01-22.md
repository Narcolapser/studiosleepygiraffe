#Because I needed something more.

There are a couple of things that lead me to the belief that I need to have a proper blog on my site. I'd resisted this for a long time because I wanted to let the automation of my git posts serve that role as much as possible. However, some things git posts don't cover. Precisely what I'm thinking about is the chili cook-off modifications I made to the SSG website. I want to capture some of what I did there, but I don't want to merge it into the main branch. Also, I want to talk a little more on my thoughts and reasons for doing certain things. Overall just things that wouldn't fit into a git post. So I'm making this new medium for myself of the blog post. So now I've got project pages, for relatively static project information, then there is the dev log, or git posts which are the git commit messages for my projects as I commit them (not that fast yet. need to automate that process). Finally, now, I'll have my blog for more length periodical thoughts and expositions.
