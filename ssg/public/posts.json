It wasn't work for a while as a result\nof the config not finding necessary values.\n\nLast time I coded I accomplished quite a number of things. I got\nthe settings screen up and running, if not fully working. I fixed\nthe issue where red wouldn't be able to fire until they recalled\ntheir torpedoes at the begining of the game. Shots that collide or\nfall into the sun now get removed from the counter. When you start\na new game, the previous shots are removed, clearing the gamefield.\nAnd I added a score keeper. I'm intending to add a \"first to x\"\ngame mode in the rules, so this puts down one of the needed\ncomponents of that.\n\nLeft to do:\nAdd an icon.\nFirst to x matches\nship selector\nnicer ships\nexplosion on ship destroyed\nsound\n\nwhich honestly isn't a particularly long list! Hopefully I'll have\nsomething up in the app store here soon. w00t w00t!\n",
