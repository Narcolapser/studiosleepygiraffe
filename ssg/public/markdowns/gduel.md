# Gravity Duel

Play with a friend to see who can blow the other one out of orbit first. Put your phone or tablet (recommended) between you and the other player. Lob shots around the sun to try to hit them. But be careful not to accidentally hit yourself! Or move to a different orbit and try to get yourself in a more opportune location. But be careful not to crash into the sun!

## Final Thoughts:

This project represents my first completed project. My first project to reach the play store. I'm not done with it in it's current status (version 0.6.0), but I am taking a hiatus.

    Plan to throw one away.

I'm going to restart this project in (hopefully) the not to distant future. This second incarnation will include network play. I feel like that by the time I shoehorn network play into the game, I would probably have rewritten the program anyway, so why not start from that point of view? So I will come back to this and rewrite it. But for now I'm going to let it sit as my first completed project.
