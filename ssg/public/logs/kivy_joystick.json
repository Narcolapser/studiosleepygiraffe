I basically\njust copied a number of files from the kivy designer over to my\ndist-packages directory. I actually had to make the kivy/tools/\npep8checker directory in order to put the files there. It was a bit\nof a mess.\n\nBut I can finally commit, as you can see. I did also make a few\nchanges worth noting. I fixed the issue where on touch move would\nbe picked up by the joystick even if it wasn't the joystick's\ntouch that moved.\n",

The last piece of behavior that is\nneeded is what happens when a touch starts inside the joystick area\nand moves out. I tried implementing it tonight, but ran into some\nbugs. It gets a little funky. Not sure where my math went wrong.\n\nThere will also need to be some work done to generalize it a little\nmore. Right now it basically has to be 200x200. I've put in some\ncalculations that attempt to deal with arbitrary sizes, but getting\na function joystick has been my first priority of course.\n",
