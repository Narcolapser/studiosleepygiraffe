# Gravity Duel 

Gravity Duel is a proof of concept game of orbital combat. Start by placing your tablet between you and a friend. You will each take control of a small ship with a torpedo launcher. Lob shots around the sun to try to hit each other. However, because you are orbiting, beware where your shots go, you could find your torpedoes are just as much a threat as your opponents'.  You must also be careful with your orbit, or you may crash into the sun or fly off the map. Your orbit can be a tool, though, moving to a different orbit may give you the advantage you need.

## Final Thoughts:

This project represents my first completed project. My first project to reach the play store. I want to come back to this later. It was never meant to be a polished good, but rather the simple act of publishing something playable, if rough, was the achievement in and of itself.

    Plan to throw one away.

Some day when I've learned more I will return to this project and rewrite it. Whether it's in Kivy, Unity3D, Unreal, or Godot remains to be seen. There is a lot I want to learn and many possible improvements. However, for now, I'm going to let it sit as my first completed project.
