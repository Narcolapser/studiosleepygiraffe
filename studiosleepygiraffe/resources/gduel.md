# Kivy Garden: Joystick
Joystick Widget, intended to get analog like input from the user via a touch screen. The input can then be used as a control of some sort. 

## Usage:

import it into your project like any other garden widget:

``` python
from kivy.garden.joystick import Joystick
```

Then there are 5 settings and 5 outputs:

background_color: The color for the whole background of the widget.
perimeter_color: Color of the perimeter line.
perimeter_line_width: the width of the perimeter line of the joystick's control area.
pad_color: Color of the control pad
pad_width: Size of the control pad

These are the values that you will get out:
pad_x & pad_y: the percent position of the pad. 

magnitude: Percent position from origin to perimeter line. mash together with radians or angle to get polar coordinates.
radians & angle: The radians/degrees around the joystick that the current position is at. It is solved first for radians, but the angle in degrees is included for simplicity for the implementer.
