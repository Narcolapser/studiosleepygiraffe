#Delta

Delta is a simple game engine whose sole purpose is to give me an educational project to learn about the machinations of game engines. It will never be an extraordinary system. Likely, Delta will ever complete or even usable. But that is not the goal. The goal is my education, which, it has performed admirably. 

Re-reading my plans for this engine, I realize I was very ambitious. But the point was to aim high. I never got to physics, let alone physics managed by the graphics card. I did learn how to program in OpenCL even if I didn't use it in this project. I did succeed in creating a system that used OpenGL and GLSL from scratch. It could load resources, used dynamic lighting, had a custom logging system, and many other features I that pleased me. Some day I may come back to it.
