So it screwed with the accuracy. I just had it bottom out. So if a drink says it's going to give you < 0 BAC, it gives you 0.\n\nI moved the BAC total to the bottom and added a naming field on the main screen. I'll look into the momentum on the ABV and OZ selectors. I think it can be done, but just didn't get to it tonight. The other thought I had was to give a dial to each digit. Which I'll do if I can't give it momentum.\n\nThe drink list now comes down with an animation. It's a bit dramatic and silly, but I so I can tone it down. I just felt like doing something fun. I believe I have fixed the squishing issue. And if I haven't fixed it sufficiently I can easily up the size of the drinks listed. I darkened the drink list background. Drinks now have an edit button and a delete button. Delete works, edit doesn't. I got stuck on some formatting issues or I might have been able to get edit to work.\n",

I just create the model and call the\nfunction.\n\nSo now materials are used to decide what a block is. This works with\nmost things, but not so much for command blocks. Materials have a\nmaximum length, and commands shoot over that really fast. So I've\ngot a hackish way of doing it right now with command replacements.\nSo there is improvements to be had, but the plugin is hardly a\nfull fledged plugin just yet, and I've got plenty to learn, so all\nin all I'd say this is going well. w00t!\n",
